# TinyFate
TinyFate is a very small version of the Fate roleplaying game.  Find out more at www.faterpg.com.  Familiarity with other RPGs will be necessary if you intend to run the game, but if you just wish to play, then all the rules are here. 

Draft version 0.3, posted 10/13/15 by Rob Donoghue

---

# Getting Started
A TinyFate game should have three to five players, one of whom will be the Game Master (or GM) and the rest of which will be players.  The expectation is that play will be around a single table, where all players have visibility into everything in play (and, in fact, we may say "the table" when we mean all the people at the table).  Obviously, if your group needs to make allowances for is membership (or wants to try a different approach, like playing online or with more of fewer players) then feel free, but the default assumption is 3-5, around a tabletop. 


---

#  Supplies
The game will need the following supplies:

* A pencil for each person, and at least one dark marker
* A stack of index cards (and something to keep them in).
* One set of four Fate dice per person
* A small bowl of tokens, like poker chips or glass beads.  Nothing edible!

Most of this stuff can be gotten anywhere, but the dice will probably require a trip to a game store, or a visit to http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-dice/

---

# Creating the Game
Before anything else, everyone at the table should get on the same page about the game.  Often someone  will pitch the idea for the game, and everyone expresses their interest.  Alternately, the table might have already decided on a game (either by discussion, or perhaps by playing a different game).  Whatever the case, it’s important that everyone is on the same page about what the game is to minimize confusion.

This is a big topic, and could probably be its own book, but I'm going to blithely proceed on the assumption that you have an idea. 
 
 ---

# Creating Characters
This step may get skipped if characters already exist, such as if the GM has pregenerated some for the game. Assuming you are creating them, every player should grab an index card.  On one side, write down your characters name and  Four aspects that describe your character (more on those in a minute).  Flip the card over, and either write a description or draw a picture (or both!) of your character.  In your description or drawing, try to include an element that reflects each aspect.  Do not hesitate to throw away cards and restart until you’re happy with the outcome.

# What is an Aspect?
An aspect is a short, descriptive word or phrase.  Examples might be “Strong”, “Student of the Ephemeral Blade”, “I Never Leave a Friend Behind”.  You can see a lot of examples at http://evilhat.wikidot.com/aspect-examples if you like.

But an aspect is more than just a description - an aspect must be *true* and *interesting.*
 
 ---

# How is an Aspect True?
True is pretty self explanatory.  If the aspect isn’t true, there’s no much point in mentioning it.  But it’s also a reminder to think about what the aspect is saying.  A very poetic aspect like “The Wind Through The Leaves” may sound great, but its meaning may not be clear, so it’s hard to say if it’s true or not. 

It is also possible that the truth creates a problem. The aspect “King of Everybody” might be interesting in some games, but in others, it can be a problem.  If an aspect is unclear or troublesome, it is the responsibility of everyone at the table to talk about it until the issue is resolved.

# How is an Aspect Interesting?
Interesting is the biggest gateway to making an aspect.  There are lots of things that are true about the character (left handed, blonde, speaks a smattering of high school french) but only the interesting ones are aspects.

Interesting may seem more challenging, because it’s easy to feel like you’re being held to some standard  of making your aspects interesting enough.  That is not what it means.  In this case, interesting means interesting to the **person writing it down**, and they are free to decide how they find it interesting.  Maybe they like the idea. Maybe it’s something you just want to do a lot.  A simple seeming  aspect like “Strong,” “Thief” or “Shy” is interesting if that’s what you want to play.

# Remember, they're Your Aspects
While it is the table’s responsibility to talk about the truth and clarity of aspects, interesting is no one else’s business but yours.  If someone else thinks your aspect would be more interesting in some other way, then they are welcome to write that on their character.  

Aspects are very important part of play - not only are they an essential part of characters, they are also part of the world.  More on that in a bit.

# Picking Your Aspects
If you're looking for ideas for your four aspects, then consider these:

* Pick one that sums up your character ("Dashing Musketeer", "Sophisticated Superspy", "Master of the Arcane Arts")
* Pick one that reflects some trouble you have. ("Sucker for a Pretty Face", "Hunted by KABAL", "Demonic Bargain")
* Pick one that reflects your role within the group and your relationships, ("Diplomat", "Fast Talker", "Butt Kicker")
* Go nuts for the last one. 

---

# Before you Begin
At the start of play, each player takes three tokens from the bowl, and the GM takes the same number of tokens (so with three players and a GM, the GM takes nine token).  After this, the person who is hosting the game (if any) takes a bonus token.  

These are Fate Points, abbreviated as FP, and they’ll be changing hands throughout the game.

Also, put down a blank card next to your character.  This is your *status card* and we'll get into that in a minute.

---

# Starting Play
Once play begins, the the GM will then describe the situation the characters find themselves in.  This may include some background information the characters would know, a physical description of the environment, or other details about what’s going on.  If relevant, she may sketch out details on paper or a whiteboard, or use figures or placeholders to illustrate things. Players may ask questions and describe how their characters act and respond to circumstances.  This may go on for some time, depending on the situation, and the GM will use her best judgement to draw events to their logical conclusion.

---

# Conflicts
Eventually, a situation will arise where the logical outcome is less obvious, either because it’s unwelcome (such as the character getting hurt), uncertain (can the characters sneak past the guard?) or otherwise something that grabs the table’s attention.  This is a conflict, and it needs to be resolved.

---

#  First, Frame the Situation
At the outset of the conflict, the GM has the option to add some aspects to the scene, which she’ll do by writing them down on cards and putting them in the middle of the table. Each card represents a distinct thing, like a character or a piece of scenery, and as such cards might have multiple aspects on them.   

This collection of aspects reflects *the scene*, and when we talk about adding or removing an aspect from the scene, we are talking about putting it on the table with these.  

---

# Characters and The Scene
If a character is in the scene, then all their aspects are considered to be in the scene as well, meaning they can be invoked by anyone involved in the scene.  If new aspects get put on the character (for good or ill) they should be written on the status card, not on the character sheet itself. 

---

# Adding Aspects
The GM has a lot of leeway in adding aspects to a scene, but there are rules that she must follow:

* If the aspect is detrimental to the characters, such as a danger or an aspect on an enemy, character, then the GM must put one fate point in the bowl for each such aspect (though the first such aspect on a scene is free).
* If the aspect is beneficial to the characters, such as an ally or obvious advantage, the GM may take one fate point from the bowl for each such aspect.
* If the aspect is neither clearly beneficial nor detrimental, such as descriptors on the scene like “thick forest” or “crowded market” then the GM may place those for free. 

As a general rule of thumb, the GM should probably be laying down between 2 and 4 cards in any given conflict - if it’s fewer, then this may just call for a simple roll (see below), and if it’s more than that, the scene better be pretty important

---

# Describe Action and Determine Difficulty
Once the situation is framed, one of the players will describe the action their character is taking, and presumably there will be some resistance.  

Based on the action the player describes, the GM will determine the difficulty based on the aspects in play on the target or on the scene.  The difficulty starts at zero, and each aspect that clearly makes the task more difficult increases it by two.   As the GM describes the situation, she should include those difficulties as she frames the situations. 

---

# Choose an Aspect
The player is about to roll dice, so they start by *invoking* an aspect. This can be any aspect they can see on the table that they think would help them.  If there is a helpful aspect, then invoking it grants a +2 to the character's roll.

This first invocation does not cost any Fate points.

---

# Rolling the Dice
Fate dice have six sides. Two of them are marked with a +, two with a - and two are blank.  When you roll them, you add them up, with the +'s equating to a +1, and the -'s equating to a -1.  So, for example: [+]() [+]() [-]()[ ]() = +1

Add the dice to the bonus from the aspect and compare it to the difficulty. If the total equals or exceed the difficulty, it's a *success*.  if not, it's a *failure*.  But it's not over yet!

---

# Dice Example

---

# Making Adjustments
After the dice have rolled, the player and the GM both have the option of altering the situation.  The player may spend a fate point (put it in the bowl)  and describe how the aspect helps him out.  The GM may reveal new aspects, adding them to the scene, or declare borderline aspects to be problems.  In either case, this increases the difficulty, but requires that she spend a fate point (giving it to the affected player).  

Only after this back and forth concludes, does the success or failure resolve. The use of difficulties and invokes can feel a bit mechanical at first, but with practice it should adopt the cadence of a conversation.

---

# Summary of a Conflict
1. Player describes action
2. GM describes difficulty and assigns a value, 2 points per opposing aspect
3. Player invokes an aspect for free (if possible) and rolls with a +2 for the invocation.
4. Optionally: Player elaborates on the description of their action and spends fate points to the bowl to invoke additional aspects, adding +2 to their result for each invocation.
5. Optionally: The GM elaborates on the scene, introducing new aspects or declaring previously benign aspect to be problems, increasing difficulty by 2. Each such introduction or declaration requires the GM give the opposing player one fate point.
6. If the player matches or exceeds the difficulty, they succeed. If not, they fail.

---

# Success
If the player succeeds, they may do one of the following:

* Add an aspect to the scene
* Remove an aspect from the scene
* Resolve the scene

Resolving the scene ends it with a particular outcome, but requires the agreement of everyone at the table.   When the player resolves the scene, he describes the outcome, though the GM may ask him to restate things if he deviates too far from play.

---

# Failure
If the player fails, then the GM may do one of the following: 

* Add an aspect to the scene
* Remove an aspect from the scene
* Resolve the scene
* Offer a Bargain

The first three options are identical to the player's options.  Offering a bargain is a special way to resolve the scene - the GM may offer the players an outcome they like (such as a resolution on their terms) but with a price.  The price is either explicit ("You can make it in time, but you'll have to leave your gear behind") or implicit (in which case the GM gets to take a fate point from the bowl).

---

# Continuing Play
If the scene is not resolved, then it has been changed in some way (for good or ill), and the players may return to describing actions and determining difficulty.

If the scene is resolved, then it's time for clean up.

---

# Clean Up
The GM gathers up all aspects on the scene except those on the character's status cards.  Anything ephemeral should be discarded, but aspects which might be relevant if the situation comes up again should be set aside and saved.  If they come up again (such as a fight in the same location, or an encounter with the same supporting character) then the GM adds them to that scene.

Players also remove any aspects on their status card which would go away with the scene change (erase or cross them out), but others may linger until the situation explicitly changes them (such as medical care to remove a wound).

---

# The next scene

Once the scene is resolved, the GM goes back to describing the situation, with players describing their actions and the GM describing reactions. Eventually there will be another conflict, and the process repeats.

---

# Speeding up Simple Conflicts

Sometimes the resolution will be a simple answer to a question - if the uncertainty was whether or not the character could do a thing, then the roll resolves it, simple as that. Setup and cleanup are skipped, and the GM simply derives difficulty from the scene as presented, and the only possible outcome of the roll is resolution or Offering a bargain.  If anyone wants to spend points to change the situation, that may be cause to do a full scene. 

---

# Using Aspects outside of Conflict
Aspects may also come up outside of conflicts - players and the GM may refer to them when describing what happens.  For example, a character with the "Army Brat" aspect might know things about military lifestyle that other characters don't.  This sort of use of aspects should be fairly common.

In a borderline case, a player may spend a fate point (to the bowl) to  assert that their aspect is usefully applicable, and the GM should roll with that.

---

# Making an Offer outside of a Conflict
If a situation comes up where a player's aspect might cause trouble, the GM may offer the player a fate point from the bowl.  If they accept, then the aspect is the source of trouble.  If they refuse, then the GM keeps moving, and goes to some other sort of trouble.

---

# Ending the Game
At the end of the game, players have the option of changing one of their aspects to reflect events in play.   Game end will also initiate another round of cleanup, where any aspects that shouldn't persist into the next game are removed (including  from the status card)


---

#  Advanced Rules: Big Effects
The GM may determine that certain outcomes may require one or more aspects be in place first.  For example, no roll is going to let a character punch down a stone wall, so the GM may require some number of aspects (usually 1-3) to "set up" the final effect.

This rule can also be applied to killing targets (or players).  it may require some number of injuries or inconveniences before "dead" is a viable outcome. 

---

# Advanced Rules: GM Veto and Player Offers
By default, the GM is the one responsible for calling out when things have gone off the rails, like a player declaring that their successful lockpick roll means they've punched out the dragon.   This is a responsibility, not an authority.  In fact, everyone at the table has the same right to object when things drift too far from reasonable.

Once players are comfortable with that responsibility, they should also consider that they can Offer a Bargain to one another when the situation calls for it. 

---

# Advanced Rules: Locations
If a scene takes place somewhere large or complicated, then the GM can lay down aspects to reflect the various "zones" of the location (she can even lay them down in a simple map).  Which location a character is in provides useful information about what they can do, and can be part of difficulty.  For example, if you try to attack someone with your sword and they're in another location, then that location probably gets folded into the difficulty (to reflect the distance you need to close).

---

# Advice to GMs

* Offer a Bargain whenever possible. It gets you fate points, and also pushes the game in fun directions.
* Failure should *never* stop play, it should merely push it in a new direction.
* Do not make players roll for anything unless you have a firm idea of how both success and failure might move the game forward.
* Be prepared for players to go in unexpected directions with success.  Roll with it.

# About this game

The original version of TinyFate was written to my blog at walkingmind.evilhat.com, and is expanded here.  The inspiration to write it up more fully was born out out a fantastic post at the *Step into RPGs* blog (https://stepintorpgs.wordpress.com).

This is eventually going to need a new name, because it's not terribly tiny, but such is life. Bruce has suggested SmallFate, and that is likely the way it will go.
